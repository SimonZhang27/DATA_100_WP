# Data Reflection NO.5

In this semester’s class, data science as a relatively new-evolving subject exceeds my traditional interpretations of computer science area and makes me realize something even more. As previous weeks’ readings suggest, data science has gradually become an indispensable factor in analyzing and measuring today’s adaptive, social, economic system though it does not look like that way from its name.


In first a few weeks, we began to have a general idea of what a data revolution is. Rather than physical, violent ones in history, data revolutions address the perspectives of other areas or subjects in order to find an optimal measurement in science. No matter it is about population, or certain number of the goods people consumed in a particular region, data science can always find a way to create a plot with its maximized ability to generate a high-resolution map and provide further help. These data after being collected can be used to simulate people’s activity pattern and possibly conclude with a model in the end. In the next few weeks, the readings we had taught us that the coding is not the whole story of data science. Different from expectations, data science demands more than that – its ability to synthesize an effective, wholesome measurement needs more socio-economic perspectives for users to evaluate and make a judgement. One another concept is kept mentioning in last week’s readings: the complexity theory. Given the tremendous amount of data, data scientists are required to combine their understanding of codes as well as their life experiences to formalize a larger, more complicated understanding in order to address some of the global problems. As Geoff West states in his article, many phenomenon in nature world and human society do not necessarily follow a scaling relationship as we have expected them to be. Instead, under the effect of complicated social economic systems, many relationships have in fact proved to be non-linear and non-proportional. Only when those data scientists have been well aware of that, could they end up with a more precise prediction for future happenings in society. When extending the data into application, new issues may arise, and such complexity should be regarded as a perfectly common theme in data world.


Last, I want to talk a bit about my prediction of data science area as a young subject. Data science may develop to be more connected with daily life, and the issues that it aims to resolve may be relevant to each one of us. Therefore, to be an excellent data scientist, the basics is always to be well informed. This includes the fundamental knowledge of programming skills, some level of machine learning, and certain amount of passion working with digital tools. But it goes far beyond that. I would say future data scientists may also be expected to know more about their life and applications for a better understanding of their work. In this way, data has a duty for today and future’s development, both urban and rural areas, both developed and developing countries. As long as it benefits humanity to some degree, data science should have its academic status and be cherished by those who want to make a contribution to our world by digital tools.
