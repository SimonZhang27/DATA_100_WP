Along with the emergence of big data technology, more applications have been transforming online and giving rise to new measurements we would not think about years ago. Kitchen in his article addresses the importance of measurements in the time of big data where examples such as travel passes, barcodes, and social media postings all present perfect opportunities of such measurements. Kitchen deploys some an example of company Facebook and its yearly report on how measurements work to impact us in its clear numerical delivery. More models have also been built in this process, some in order to promote AI technology, and they all somehow depend on the way we measure, the codes we edited, or even the perspectives we take.

However, the big data dealings today are not as easy as it seemed to be. Unlike the sole programming techniques, big data revolution now has a more complicated shift, from a single field to interdisciplinary understanding of the ways we use these measurements. In this Kitchen’s article Big Data, new epistemologies and paradigm shifts, many experts including Kitchen commented that data analysis is on a revolutionized way that considers and shapes different areas in a sense that data scientists have to evaluate them in a general perspective. In other words, collecting data is nothing new today, but the way we really see differs from the past. For example, after the gathering of a set of data, we may want to see the relationship of several variables whether as correlational or causal, which largely depends on the understanding of statistics techniques, a set of work that a mathematician typically does. Another example even better illustrates the roles of interdisciplinary studies in today’s big data revolution. In the article, it also suggests another example in literature. When big data of literal analysis processes, it has to confront some problems that overlap with areas other than the field of data science, most times in terms of the subjective interpretation of how it should go. 

Furthermore, data deluge can help us in the way that better interprets patterns, relationships, and even human behaviors. Rather than the traditional scientific methods, big data produces meaningful and insightful knowledge of complex human behaviors in and relations according to the patterns it collected over a period of time. Also, intersection with other social science or humanities areas of big data largely helps with the understanding of human behaviors, too. For instance, the positivistic approaches combine with many social sciences such as economics, political science and sociology. All these areas share one feature in common, which is to analyze human behaviors in a large context of data. Therefore, data science revolutions in the 21st century will step forward these areas across disciplines, meanwhile gaining priceless insight of human behaviors and their relationships.
