(PS: As I ran the very last step in transforming my 2D plot into 3D, it showed that it cannot transform into the picture I expected as shown in your webpage paradigm, Professor. Sorry, I have tried at least three times including closing them and re-openning them, but my 3D model plot never changes. The 2D plots shown above are exactly right as I have expected them to be. But just at the very last step it does not work in making it into a 3D format - I guess the reason has something to do with my XQuartz software in computer; it cannot update to the lastest version for some reasons. I have checked with my friends in this class, and it appears that I get the same result as them except for the last 3D-angle plot. I even doublecheck all my codes and they seem perfectly okay. I'm really sorry for this missing 3D plot, though I have got all the others 3D and 2D plots there (already shown above). That being said, I am still able to generally envision what it looks like, but it's just hard to be presented on my computer...
