# 3rd Data Science Reflection

Owen Barder thinks development should be defined as a property of an economic and social system consistent with contemporary social values and help people in a society obtain higher living standards. He extends Amartya Sen’s definition by evaluating it at a broader perspective – the process of expansion and embodiment of human freedom. 

Toaster project by Thomas Thwaites is a project attempting to build a simple electric appliance from scratch, by purchasing the raw materials from zero bases. The significance of such project is to show that even building a basic toaster may require more than we thought it would need, which well reflects a microcosm of the complexity of an economic system and the world.

Barder argues in the video that the economic models can somewhat predict a general trend (which he later explains with an example of predictions of London’s July weather), but he also believes that some details of economic growth may not limited to the traditional interpretations and methods those economic models can apply to. This also resonates with the concept of complexity he keeps mentioning. In real world, the model also suggests that developing countries, in order to develop with higher national total output, need both increased amount in labor and capitals, but the reality showed otherwise. In fact, Barder later concludes that developing countries have a large amount of labor, but the problem of their development has something to do with the management and corruption of a country politics. 

Steve Jones is a British geneticist whose main area is in studying evolution. As he started his career, he worked in a factory making soap powder and helped design a better nozzle at uni-lever. Steve Jones was only response for only one component in that process, but any invention may require different and a large number of attempts and designs. As a result, Steve Jones provided massive amount of improvements to the soap powder industry.

Complex adaptive system is a complex system that requires dynamic network of interactions. It is also adaptive because in a societal context, people, firms, and institutions all need to interact with each other corresponding to both predictable and unpredictable changes. Two basic features, as its name itself suggests, are complex and adaptive as I have explained above.

Haile Selassie is the Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974. According to Barder, Haile got up every morning feeding wild lions while his secret police reported to him the network and then assignments. In such case, it is difficult for police to tell Haile the poverty, starvation, and other downside problems of the countryside.

There are two basic reasons why Barder recommends to resist engineering as a policy implication. First, evolutionary processes always outperform designs, which in broader sense means that each product and institution has to adapt with the changes in each certain environment. Second, dynamics means it is generally unlikely to predict what is going to happen in a system. Isomorphic mimicry means in animal world that some animals evolve the appearance of being more threatening than they actually are. In a country policing, it means an organization only should work as it looks but does not work well as a matter of fact. It only has some characteristics, but does not change flexibly with the environment.

Barder also suggests we should resist fatalism because we do not have to accept outcome whatever it is, but instead we could shape the evolution today. For example, Norman Borlaug, the man who brought about the Green Revolution, in which he actively intervened in the evolutionary process and managed to produce a high-yield disease resistant wheat varieties. In this way, he saved more than a billion people from starvation.
