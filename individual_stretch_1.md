# Written comparison of three different sources
The plot of HDX is different from that of GADM. The former is collected from the source, UNISDR, United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. It's definitely not the primary source, but rather secondary or even tertiary. In terms of their differences, I plotted the HDX graph from its .shp file in RStuodio, similar to what I did to GADM, but differently from GADM, HDX does not have a ADM1 & ADM2 .shp files of Croatia on its website, so only a general profile was sketched. Clearly, GADM matches more closely with the local political reality than HDX. 
For files in geoBoundaries, I downloaded the unstandardized version and found that it was relatively very precise. I guess its source comes from the GIS software program or something as I briefly skimmed a .txt called CITATION, so I think geoBoundaries might have some specific softwares that associates with satellite technology and therefore able to draw a precise map of subdivisions of Croatia.
