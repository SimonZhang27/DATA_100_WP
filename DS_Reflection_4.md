Geoff West started up his article by relating to the origins of our beings – not just homo sapiens, but also every type of species and creatures. To introduce one of the meanings of uses of scale in today, West gave several examples to better illustrate how it can be useful and effective in helping humanity understand their origins, their histories, and their contemporary development under today’s specific socio-economic structures. 

The first example I can think of is when West mentions about measurement of GDP, by which he tries to make a point that the measurement of it is actually non-linear. In the similar manner, an economic growth typically comprises so many factors that it would be imprecise to assert its linearity when people attempt to measure it. Instead, West argues that scale plays an important role in this part in it. In terms of explaining what scaling means, West writes that scaling indicates how a system responds when its size changes. Then under this example of GDP measurement, when an index such as a company is halved, it is not always true that its profits go halved as a result. Instead, West points out the importance of considering dynamics of a system and puts forward a complexity theory, through which he gave another two examples to demonstrate that something may be hard to define but we know when we see or experience it. This, in some sense, explains why GDP measurement may not always be linear but can be sublinear or otherwise.

The second example would be the nonlinear scaling between food and energy consumed by animals. In order to back up his arguments, West collected some numerical evidence as support that even when an animal increases its size by twice, it only needs 75% more food and energy rather than 100%. In this computation, we need to take metabolic rate of that species into account rather than simply linearize by its scale. This example, however, greatly reminds us that in order to support human development of an economic system, scaling does not often go along with linearity in some circumstances. 

The last example is about urbanization, which West mainly talks about in this article, West Scale. More than once, West repetitively makes a point that cities are organic, which means they can self-regulate under socio-economic terms. West later gave an example of city New York, the greenest city as a result of a by-product of the dynamics underlying economics. Almost to everyone’s surprise, New York achieves this, according to West, is due to its city planning and by-product effects of urban policies, reflecting an idea of sublinearly than pure linearity. 

More correlations exist between factors that we normally think are linear but in fact not, such as superlinearity -- systematic increasing returns of scale. In the second half of the article, West believes that today data’s function is to “construct, test, and refine” our theories and models. In this process, bare theories are not far enough; instead, big data should be analyzed in context in our applications combined with book theories when into practice. 

Last, West also thinks a theory is relevant in the face of big data, and an example of this would be inter-disciplinary or inter-disciplinary studies in education field. To process big data, we need interpretations that come across different fields with different kinds of theories. In today’s most popular techniques such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, or data analytics, we need to be aware that different theories from different fields and perspectives help this work a lot easier than it should be. According to West, Science is meritocratic and not all are equal. With these differences, we would apply the theories into uses of big data and build urbanization in the near future.
