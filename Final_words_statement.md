# Final report

At the HDX website, I picked and downloaded files of Croatian road network and its health facilities files and therefore able to give several plots of them. 

For road network system in Split, the second largest, most populous city I selected in Croatia, it presents different levels of the roads in terms of their respective characteristics, some of which are one-way, paved, with different number of layers, different uses for highway, etc. I tried to categorize them into primary, secondary, and tertiary based on these characteristics. After plotting them, I combined the pattern of population who resides in Split with road network and found it was interesting that the most populous area is not actually the area where road network concentrates most. However, these different levels of roads do connect these most populous areas in Split altogether in some way. 

Similarly, I produced a plot on some health care facilities in Split, too. Based on several most typical indices such as hospitals, clinics, doctors…, I plotted them on map and discovered that they are mostly located in the middle of road maps I plotted, which makes sense in reality because hospitals and clinics are usually built in urban areas with convenient and accessible traffic. 

As the last step, I tried to plot all these plots in a three-dimension degree and found that it was easier and clearer to observe all these roads and health care facilities in a 3-D graph. Such topography enhanced my understanding of Croatia’s geographical format of its city planning and how population may reside around within this large district, Split. Compared to other plots, this final last plot gives me a more direct sense of how far and how approachable for local Croatian residents to go shopping, medical check, or other routine stuff. I also communicated with my other friends in this class on the plots we get. Some of them selected African countries which are not as developed as my selected country, Croatia (developed country). Therefore, it is visually evident that our road networks and health facilities exhibit different extent of complexity on map as well. As a conclusion, these plots are sometimes a good signal for us to visualize developmental differences between developing and developed countries.
